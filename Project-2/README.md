# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

The goal of this project is to combine everything you have learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas so you can see how it all works together. For this project, you will start with this messy data set [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1). 

* import the dataset
* analyse the data using pandas
* clean it up
* prepare it to be analyzed
* export it as a clean CSV

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* The dataset that we provide you is a significantly messy data set. Apply the different cleaning and manipulation techniques you have learned.
* Import the data using Pandas.
* Examine the data for potential issues.
* Use at least 8 of the cleaning and manipulation methods you have learned on the data.
* Produce a Jupyter Notebook that shows the steps you took and the code you used to clean and transform your data set.
* Export a clean CSV version of your data using Pandas.

## Deliverables

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **A ``README.md`` file**

## Steps for cleaning and analyzing

* Examine the size of the data set
* Examine the shape
* Examine the first few records
* Examine the last few records
* Rename columns
* Drop duplicate columns
* Drop columns which have NaN values for more than 40%
